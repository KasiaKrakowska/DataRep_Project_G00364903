# Project Description
As part of Data Representation and Querying module, I was required to develop an React application using MERN technology stack, on the topic of my choice. As per requirement the app includes multiple components, client side routing, the server to create, read, update and delete data from the database. CSS was used to style selected elements to enhance visual aspect of the app. I opted for clean, simplistic design, using white space to enhance the elements. 

## Introduction
The project was developed using MERN technology stack. MERN stands for MongoDB, Express, React, Node (MongoDB - document database, Express(.js) - Node.js web framework, React(.js) - a client-side JavaScript framework, Node(.js) - the premier JavaScript web server).

## Technologies
Technologies used to develop project are as follows:

* Languages: JavaScript, HTML, CSS
* Libraries: Bootstrap, Mongoose, React-Bootstrap, React-router-dom
* Frameworks: ReactJS, Express,
* Databases: MongoDB,
* Environments: NodeJs, Visual Studio Code, Git,

## Prerequisite
* NodeJS
* Git
* MongoDB
* Visual Studio Code

# Application Function
Simple, minimalistic, application to showcase art. 
App is used to create, read, update and delete data about sample art pieces (paintings). Gallery section contains information that include Title, Price, Photo. User can add new item using form available in Upload tab of navigation menu. To view items, user can select Gallery tab in navigation menu. There user can edit selected item or remove it. 

## User Guide
* In order to run application user need start server in terminal with command: node server.js.
* Both frontend and backend will start. In browser user need to type http://localhost:4000
* Once application starts, user will see Home page with navigation menu containing 4 tabs - Home, Gallery, Upload, Contact. Logo used in navigation is linked with home page.
* Home - some information about service
* Gallery - contains cards with images of paintings, price and title. On the bottom of each card are two buttons. Update button allows to change information about selected painting, Remove button, deletes painting from database.
* Upload - contains form allowing to add new item to database. Once all the fields are complete, user can press the Upload button and new item will be visible in Gallery.
* Contact - contact form
* Each page(component) has footer with basic contact information and functioning email address.
